- 👋 Hi, I’m @fgyambao
- 👀 I’m interested in doing DIYs, interior designing, room improvements, autocad and solidworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python which I'm looking forward to improving and then switching to C# and maybe JAVA. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programmers to further enhance my learning experience and possibly changing the future and giving back to the community.
- 📫 How to reach me... You may reach me here first as I'm still learning my best to understand programming. ;)
